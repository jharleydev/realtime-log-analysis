This project is an implementation of common practice log analysis using python and other various technologies. 


In this project we extract logs from NASA and process them using the streaming solutions provided by Apache Spark and Apache Kafka. 
Beyond processing we provide a set of monitoring interfaces for developers. 

See below for the general data architecture.
